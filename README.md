⚽ Striker Segmentation & Classification
📖 Overview

This project applies data analytics and machine learning to analyze 500 football strikers and segment them into categories such as Best Strikers and Regular Strikers.

The workflow includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Descriptive and statistical analysis

Clustering with KMeans

Classification using Logistic Regression

scikit-learn, statsmodels

🚀 How to Run

Navigate to the notebooks/ folder.

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Project_Strikers_Performance.ipynb

📊 Key Results

Maximum goals scored by a striker: 34

Portion of right-footed players: 68%

Best Strikers (Cluster 0) → Average Total Contribution Score: 120.5

Logistic Regression Accuracy: 86%

🔄 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning → Handle missing values, encoding, scaling

Descriptive & Statistical Analysis → Goals, assists, foot preference, etc.

Feature Engineering → Create Total Contribution Score, encode categorical features

Clustering (KMeans) → Identify groups of strikers

Classification (Logistic Regression) → Classify into Best vs. Regular Strikers

Model Evaluation → Accuracy, insights, and interpretation
