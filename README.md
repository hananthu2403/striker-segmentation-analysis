# striker-segmentation-analysis
Data analytics and machine learning project to segment and classify strikers based on performance metrics.

# ⚽ Striker Segmentation & Classification

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes 500 football strikers using **data analytics and machine learning** to segment and classify them into categories such as **Best Strikers** and **Regular Strikers**.  

The analysis covers:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Descriptive and statistical analysis  
- Clustering with KMeans  
- Logistic Regression classification model  

## 📂 Project Files
- `Strikers_performance.xlsx` → Dataset of 500 strikers  
- `Project_Strikers_Performance.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn, statsmodels  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project_Strikers_Performance.ipynb

## 📊 Key Results
- Maximum goals scored by a striker: 34
- Portion of right-footed players: 68%
- Best Strikers (Cluster 0) average total contribution score: 120.5
- Logistic Regression Model Accuracy: 86%

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
2. Descriptive & Statistical Analysis
3. Feature Engineering (Total Contribution Score, Encoding)
4. Clustering with KMeans
5. Classification with Logistic Regression
6. Model Evaluation & Insights
